AppTemplate for Appcelerator Titanium
=====================================

This is a basic App Template for Titanium Mobile projects.

Is based on CommonJS modules and saves a lot of time creating the initial boilerplate project structure.

Also, includes a a basic and extensible Tools library with usefull project tools.

All module paths should be declared in ModulePaths.js, so all module paths are isolated from code.
